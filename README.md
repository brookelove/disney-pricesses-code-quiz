##Summary
This was a hard assignment because I did not completely understand javaScript. It felt like I was faking it until I made it. Durning that time I realized that after fixing a error and, then I think what really motivated me to conduct this project were the small accomplishments that I made. Understanding smaller pieces to the whole part of javascript and then go from there.
