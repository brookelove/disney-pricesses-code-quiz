To begin my project i first wireframed whoat I wanted everything to loook like. I like for my wireframes to be pretty open to color-wise but plan out where everythign ultimatly lies in my website. The overall layout would be to be able to start the quiz and go through the qustions and end page without having a problem. 

##Mock up 
After completting the code with a backbone of HTML, CSS, and a whole lot of pixie dust. I came up with this!

##Summary
This was a hard assignment because I did not completely understand javaScript. It felt like I was faking it until I made it. Durning that time I realized that after fixing a error and, then I think what really motivated me to conduct this project were the small accomplishments that I made. Understanding smaller pieces to the whole part of javascript and then go from there.
